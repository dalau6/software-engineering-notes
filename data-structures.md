# Data Structures
A [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) is a concete representation of data, from the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

A [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) is an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

An [abstract data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) is a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior ([semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_%28computer_science%29) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of:
  - possible values
  - possible operations on data of this type
  - the behavior of these operations.

For example, a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28abstract_data_type%29) is an abstract data type. Here are some data structures that can be used to implement a graph:
- [Adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list)
- [Adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix)
- [Incidence matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix)

A [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28computer_science%29) is a type of graph. Trees and lists are also abstract data types.

## [Primitive Data Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_type)
- [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type): true or false
- [Character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_%28computing%29)
- [Integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_%28computer_science%29)
- [Floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point)
- [Fixed point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic)
- [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_%28computer_science%29) (a.k.a. pointer or handle)
- [Enumerated type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type)

## [Composite Data Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_type)
- [Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) (e.g. string)
- [Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_%28computer_science%29) (a.k.a. structure or [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple%29)
- [Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_%28computer_science%29)

## [Collections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_%28data_structure%29)
- [Linked data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data_structure)
  - [Linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)

### [Linear collections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_data_structure)
We call a data structure linear if its elements form a sequence. 
- [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29)
- [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29) (a.k.a. LIFO)
- [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_%28abstract_data_type%29) (a.k.a. FIFO)
  - [Priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)
  - [Double-ended queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue) (a.k.a. deque, pronounced deck)
  - [Double-ended priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_priority_queue)
- [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28computer_science%29)
- [Multiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset_%28abstract_data_type%29) (a.k.a. bag)
- [Associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) (a.k.a. map, dictionary, or symbol table)
  - [Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

### Nonlinear collections

  - [Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29)
  - [Search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_tree)
    - [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (a.k.a. prefix tree)
