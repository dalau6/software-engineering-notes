# [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)

- A graph is a network of connected nodes.
- A connection with a direction is an arc.
- A connection without a direction is an edge.
- A connection can have a weight or cost.
- A graph with directions is called a [directed graph, or digraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph).
- A graph with weights is called a weighted graph.
- You may want to visit every node: the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
- You may want to find the shortest or cheapest path.

# Representations
You can represent a graph as a list of edges or arcs:
- 1 -> 2
- 2 -> 3
- 2 -> 4
- 3 -> 4
- 3 -> 5
- 3 -> 6
- 4 -> 1
- 4 -> 5
- 5 -> 2

You can represent a graph as a [dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) of [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29), where each key is a node, and each value is a list of connected nodes.
```python3
graph = {1: [2],
         2: [3, 4],
         3: [4, 5, 6],
         4: [1, 5],
         5: [2]}
```
